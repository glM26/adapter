# @sasjs/adapter

SASjs is a open-source framework for building Web Apps on SASÂ® platforms. You can use as much or as little of it as you like. This repository contains the JS adapter, the part that handles the to/from SAS communication on the client side. There are 3 ways to install it:

1 - `npm install @sasjs/adapter` - for use in a node project

2 - [Download](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@sasjs/adapter@1/index.js) and use a copy of the latest JS file

3 - Reference directly from the CDN - in which case click [here](https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/npm/@sasjs/adapter?tab=collection) and select "SRI" to get the script tag with the integrity hash.

If you are short on time and just need to build an app quickly, then check out [this video](https://vimeo.com/393161794) and the [react-seed-app](https://github.com/sasjs/react-seed-app) which provides some boilerplate.

## None of this makes sense. How do I build an app with it?

Ok ok. Deploy this [example.html](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sasjs/adapter/master/example.html) file to your web server, and update `servertype` to `SAS9` or `SASVIYA` depending on your backend.

The backend part can be deployed as follows:

```
%let appLoc=/Public/app/readme;  /* Metadata or Viya Folder per SASjs config */
filename mc url "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sasjs/core/main/all.sas";
%inc mc; /* compile macros (can also be downloaded & compiled seperately) */
filename ft15f001 temp;
parmcards4;
  %webout(FETCH) /* receive all data as SAS datasets */
  proc sql;
  create table areas as select make,mean(invoice) as avprice
    from sashelp.cars
    where type in (select type from work.fromjs)
    group by 1;
  %webout(OPEN)
  %webout(OBJ,areas)
  %webout(CLOSE)
;;;;
%mp_createwebservice(path=&appLoc/common,name=getdata)
```

You now have a simple web app with a backend service!
